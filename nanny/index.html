        Later on in 2013, she received several certifications,the Baby Care Certification by First AID Web Inc and National Health Safety Foundation, Babysitter Lessons and Safety Training by the American Academy of Paediatrics, USA. Infant First Aids recognition by the Mexican Red Cros and more recently the Yoga Kids Families Instructor Certification by Rainbow Kids Yoga and Yoga Alliance.

        For a wedding, we surely will make the day less stressful by creating an environment where the children can have their own "wedding time party."  We will provide board games, arts and crafts, as well as toys and play games (treasure hunts, lawn bowling, Frisbee golf, etc.)

        For corporate events, conferences, conventions or trade-shows: our babysitting team fits each client's  budget, when parents have the option to bring their children, clients report higher attendance. We work hand and hand with event planners, DMC’s and venues to arrange all the childcare needed to provide a seamless transition between the parents and nanny staff.

        In-villa babysitting service: your children will be looked after in the safety of your own vacation rental, Airbnb or event venue! Every sitter arrives with a bag of games, books, and age-appropriate activities. In addition upon request, they have sitters who can care for families of children with special needs or speak other languages.

        Whether you need a bilingual babysitter for a couple of hours or a full team  of them while on vacation, from La Paz to Los Cabos, Los Barriles or anywhere in between, you can be sure your children will be in great hands with Lili and her team.

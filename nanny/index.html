        Lili, a native of Baja who was born in Mulege and raised in La Paz, has lived in many places like Brownsville, Texas. She is a trained certified babysitter, a yoga instructor for kids as well as adults. She is also the co-founder and manager at Baja Kids Lab.<br>
        <br>
        Her career with children started in the summer of 2001 at the Center of Psychological and Alternative Therapies in Toluca City, where she worked as teacher's assistant with a group of twenty or more special learning needs children between the ages of 5 and 12.<br>
        <br>
        Later on, in 2013, she received several certifications:<br>
        <br>
        <ul style="text-align: left; margin-left: 40px">
          <li>the <b>Baby Care Certification</b> by First AID Web Inc. and National Health Safety Foundation
          <li><b>Babysitter Lessons and Safety Training</b> by the American Academy of Paediatrics, USA
          <li><b>Infant First Aids</b> recognition by the Mexican Red Cros
          <li>and the <b>Yoga Kids Families Instructor Certification</b> by Rainbow Kids Yoga and Yoga Alliance, more recently
        </ul>

        For a wedding, we will surely make the day less stressful by creating an environment where the children can have their own "wedding time party." We will provide board games, arts and crafts, as well as toys and play games (treasure hunts, lawn bowling, Frisbee golf, etc.)<br>
        <br>
        For corporate events, conferences, conventions or trade-shows: our babysitting team fits each client's budget, when parents have the option to bring their children, clients report higher attendance. We work hand-in-hand with event planners, DMCâ€™s and venues to arrange all the childcare needed to provide a seamless transition between the parents and nanny staff.<br>
        <br>
        In-villa babysitting service: your children will be looked after in the safety of your own vacation rental, Airbnb or event venue! Every sitter arrives with a bag of games, books, and age-appropriate activities. In addition upon request, they have sitters who can care for families of children with special needs or speak other languages.<br>
        <br>
        Whether you need a bilingual babysitter for a couple of hours or a full team of them while on vacation, from La Paz to Los Cabos, Los Barriles or anywhere in between, you can be sure your children will be in great hands with Lili and her team.
